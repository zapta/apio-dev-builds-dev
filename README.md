## Installing Apio
-----

### All supported platforms

#### Using a Python pip package

If you have Python installed on your system, you can use this method to install Apio as a Pip package.

**Install**

1. Run `python --version` and verify that you have a 'reasonably recent' python version. (Apio's minimum Python requirement is specified in its [project file](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/blob/develop/pyproject.toml)).

2. Install the latest Apio code by running the following command.

```
pip install --force-reinstall -U git+https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio.git@develop#egg=apio
```

3. Run `apio` in a new shell to test the installation.


**Uninstall**

1. Delete the `apio` pip package by running `pip uninstall apio`.

2. Delete the Apio settings directory `.apio` under your home directory.

### Mac OSX (Apple Silicon)

#### Using an installer

**Install**

1. Download the installer file **apio-darwin-arm64-[version]-[date]-installer.pkg** from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).

2. Run the following command in the directory where you downloaded the installer file (replace `[version]` and `[date]` with the actual values) this will allow the unsigned installer to run.

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine apio-darwin-arm64-[version]-[date]-installer.pkg
```

1. Double click on the installer file and follow the instructions.

2. Run `apio` in a new shell to test the installation.

**Unnstall**

1. Delete the `apio` application from `Applications`.

2. Delete the Apio settings directory `.apio` under your home directory.



#### Using a file bundle


**Install**

1. Download the bundle file **apio-darwin-arm64-[version]-[date]-bundle.zip** from the [latest release](../../releases/latest).

2. Unzip the bundle file. This will create an `apio` directory with the application files.

3. Run the following shell command in the `apio` directory to allow the unsigned files of the Apio app to run.
